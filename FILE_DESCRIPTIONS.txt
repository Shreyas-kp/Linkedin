Project: linkedin-post-optimizer (folder root: c:\Users\Shreyas Kaushik\Projects\Linkedin)

This document describes the purpose of each file and folder in the repository. Use it for onboarding, debugging, and planning feature work. Where I inferred behavior from filenames or usage patterns I noted reasonable assumptions.

---

ROOT / top-level files

index.html
- The single-page app host HTML for Vite; mounts React app into <div id="root"> and bootstraps /src/main.tsx via a module script.

README.md
- Project readme with high-level description and usage notes. Good first place for developer setup instructions.

package.json
- npm manifest; scripts and dependencies. Key scripts: `dev` (vite), `build` (vite build), `preview`, `lint`, `test`.
- Dependencies: react, react-dom, zustand, idb.
- Dev deps: vite, tailwindcss, postcss, vitest, eslint, typescript, etc.

package-lock.json
- npm lockfile for reproducible installs.

vite.config.ts
- Vite configuration for the dev server and build. Handles React plugin and other Vite features.

vitest.config.ts
- Test runner (vitest) configuration.

tsconfig.json
- TypeScript compiler options for the project.

tailwind.config.js
- Tailwind CSS configuration (theme customization, darkMode setting). Tailwind generates utility classes used by the app.

postcss.config.js
- PostCSS config that wires Tailwind and autoprefixer for CSS processing during build/dev.

.vscode/ or .github/ (if present)
- CI configs and workflow definitions are under `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (automated checks/builds).

.prettierrc
- Prettier configuration for code formatting.

.eslintrc.cjs
- ESLint configuration for linting rules.

.gitignore
- Files and folders excluded from git (node_modules, build outputs, artifacts).

architecture.html
- Internal architecture notes/diagram (project-specific documentation).

linkedin-post-optimizer.zip, linkedin-post-optimizer (1).zip
- Archive exports of the project (not required for local dev). Can be removed if stale.

CSV / data files (scraped data and mock data)
- job_listings.csv, mock_courses.csv, mock_data.csv, online_courses.csv, scraped_jobs_aggregated.csv, scraped_linkedin_jobs.csv, etc.
- These are sample or scraped datasets used by the ML utilities or for sample data in the UI.

served_index_css.txt, vite_page.html
- Artifacts produced while debugging/running the dev server. `served_index_css.txt` contains the CSS bundle/module served by Vite; `vite_page.html` is a saved copy of the dev server root HTML. Useful debug artifacts; can be removed later.

src/ (main frontend source)

src/main.tsx
- React entry point. Creates React root and renders `<App />`. Also imports `./index.css` so Tailwind layers and custom CSS load.
- NOTE: a small runtime debug badge was added to help verify whether `index.css` is applied in the browser.

src/index.css
- Main stylesheet entry. Expected to include Tailwind `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;` and project-level custom rules.
- This file was recently edited to avoid problematic `@apply dark:...` constructs and to include resilient fallback CSS for critical layout to prevent UI breakage when Tailwind processing fails.

src/styles.css
- Legacy / alternate stylesheet. Historically the app used this file; make sure `src/main.tsx` imports `index.css` (it does now). If `styles.css` still appears in the browser network tab, it may indicate a stale bundle or cache referencing it.

src/App.tsx
- Main application component. Composes header, layout, editor, generator, and metrics panel. Entry used in production/dev to orchestrate the UI.

src/App_new.tsx
- Alternative or experimental version of App. Likely a refactor or staging branch kept in the repo.

src/components/
- Reusable React UI components and pages. Files include:

  Button.tsx
  - Small, theme-aware button component used across the app. Encapsulates styling and optional icon slot.

  Card.tsx
  - Generic card container used for panels and content blocks.

  Header.tsx
  - Top navigation/header bar. Contains app title, theme toggle, and other global controls.

  Layout.tsx
  - Page layout wrapper. Likely handles two-column layout (sidebar + main content) and responsive behavior.

  PostGenerator.tsx
  - Component with controls to generate post drafts (calls localGenerator or PostGenerationService). There are two variants: `PostGenerator.tsx` and `PostGenerator_new.tsx`.

  PostGenerator.tsx.bak
  - Backup copy of older generator component. Keep only for reference; consider removing when code stabilizes.

  EnhancedPostGenerator.tsx
  - Experimental or more feature-rich generator UI, likely integrates RAG style library and additional inputs.

  LinkedInPostBuilder.tsx
  - Component that composes the final post preview (how it will appear on LinkedIn) and provides interaction controls (edit, copy, export).

  PostEditor.tsx
  - Editor UI for editing the text of a post. Likely uses a textarea or rich-text area and emits the edited content to parent.

  TextArea.tsx
  - Encapsulated textarea control used by `PostEditor` with sizing and theme styles.

  Input.tsx
  - Small input field component for single-line text fields.

  StyleLibrary.tsx
  - UI for the RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) style library. Lets users browse / select writing styles/examples to apply to generated posts.

  SettingsSidebar.tsx
  - Settings panel used as a sidebar for toggles, export, theme, and other preferences.

  HashtagDisplay.tsx
  - Component that displays suggested hashtags and allows clicking to add them to a post.

  MetricsPanel.tsx
  - Shows various metrics and predictions about the current post (engagement predictions, readability, etc.).

  MetricIndicator.tsx
  - Small visual indicator for a single metric (e.g. engagement score with color/threshold mapping).

  Card.tsx (already listed)
  - Reusable layout card used for panels.

  LinkedInPostBuilder.tsx (listed)
  - As above; part of the preview / publish workflow.

src/context/

  ThemeContext.tsx
  - React context that manages theme (light/dark) and toggles the `dark` root class. Components consume this to adapt styling.

src/components/Header.tsx
- Top bar that may include the ThemeContext toggle and app-level actions (e.g., open settings).

src/services/
- Client-side services (mostly TypeScript) that implement business logic, integrations, and adapters. Key files:

  localGenerator.ts
  - A local in-browser generator: likely contains heuristics or a lightweight model to produce post drafts without external calls.

  PostGenerationService.ts
  - Higher-level wrapper around generation flows; may call localGenerator, RAGService, or external endpoints if configured.

  RAGService.ts
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation helper: fetches style examples from the style library or vector store and uses them to guide generation.

  vectorStore.ts
  - Simple vector store adapter for storing and retrieving embeddings; may wrap `idb` or in-memory store.

  hashtagSuggester.ts
  - Service that suggests hashtags for a given post text (heuristics or small ML model).

  engagementPredictor.ts
  - Predicts engagement score for a post. There is an ML model under `ml/` that likely relates to this service.

  toxicityChecker.ts
  - Runs a lightweight toxicity check on post content and flags unsafe text.

src/utils/

  postFormatting.ts
  - Utilities for formatting a post (escaping, removing excess whitespace, preparing CSV lines, etc.). Used by export or copy functions.

  enhancedGenerator.ts
  - Helper utilities used by EnhancedPostGenerator. Might contain text transformation helpers.

src/data/

  examples.json
  - JSON file with example posts or writing-style examples used by the style library and RAG retrieval.

---

ml/ (python-based ML utilities and artifacts)

ml/__init__.py
- Package init for python utilities used locally for model training or inference.

ml/utils.py
- Python helper functions for preprocessing data, reading CSVs, tokenization helpers, vectorization helpers.

ml/merge_and_label.py
- Script to merge multiple scraped datasets and produce labeled training data for the engagement predictor model.

ml/train_model1.py
- Training script that trains a model (e.g., PyTorch or scikit-learn) to predict engagement and writes artifacts to `ml/artifacts/`.

ml/requirements.txt
- Python requirements for ML tooling (torch, scikit-learn, joblib, etc.). Use a separate venv to run ML scripts.

ml/artifacts/

  model.pt
  - Trained model weights (PyTorch or similar). Used as a reference or for exporting model predictions.

  vectorizer.joblib
  - Serialized vectorizer used for text feature extraction.

  labels.joblib
  - Label encoding or similar artifacts for mapping model outputs.

---

config and CI

.github/workflows/ci.yml
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI: runs lint, tests, and build checks on PRs/changes.

---

Other notes / debug artifacts

served_index_css.txt
- Saved copy of the CSS module Vite served while debugging. Useful to inspect the final produced CSS (HMR wrapping included).

vite_page.html
- Saved copy of the dev server's served page. Useful if you want to reproduce or debug requests offline.

src/components/PostGenerator.tsx.bak
- Backup: keep for reference but prune when not needed to reduce confusion.

---

Guidance: how to keep this document accurate
- Re-generate/update this file when you add/remove files. I can automate that if you want: I can write a script that scans the repo and produces an updated `FILE_DESCRIPTIONS.txt` summarizing files and reading top-lines of each file for heuristics.

How to use these descriptions when debugging
- If the UI is missing styles: check `src/main.tsx` import (should import `src/index.css`) and inspect `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` for compatibility with Tailwind/PostCSS versions.
- If predictions are missing: check `src/services/engagementPredictor.ts` and whether the ML artifacts under `ml/artifacts` are referenced or whether the service is stubbed to return random scores.
- If generation fails: inspect `src/services/PostGenerationService.ts` and `src/services/localGenerator.ts`.

Quick commands (Windows PowerShell) to run dev and tests

- Install deps:
  npm.cmd install

- Start dev server (Vite):
  npm.cmd run dev

- Run tests:
  npm.cmd test

---

If you want, I can now:
- (A) Produce a markdown version (`FILE_DESCRIPTIONS.md`) with links and TODO markers to fill missing details.
- (B) Auto-scan each source file and include a 1–2 line summary extracted from the file header / first non-comment lines (more precise, but requires reading all files).
- (C) Start implementing one of the TODO features we created earlier.

Tell me which follow-up you want.
